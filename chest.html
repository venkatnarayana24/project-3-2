            <div class="work1"><h1>Chest Dumbell Press </h1>
                <p>Muscles Targeted:<br>
                    Chest (Pectoralis Major):<br> The primary muscle group engaged during the dumbbell bench press.<br>
                    Shoulders (Anterior Deltoids):<br> These muscles assist in stabilizing the movement.<br>
                    Triceps:<br> They play a secondary role in extending the arms during the press.<br></p>
            </div>
            <div class="work2">
                <h1>Cable flies ( lower chest)
                </h1>
                <p>Targeted Muscle Group:<br> The lower chest cable fly specifically focuses on the lower pectoral muscles (pecs). It helps develop the abdominal head of the pectoralis major.<br></p>
            </div>
            <div class="work3">
                <h1>INCLINE PUSH-UPS
                </h1>
                <p>Upper Chest:<br> Inclined push-ups still work the chest muscles (pectoralis major), but they place more emphasis on the upper portion of the chest compared to standard push-ups. This is because the elevated position shifts more of the workload to the upper chest.<br>
                   
Anterior Deltoids (Front Shoulders):<br> Like standard push-ups, inclined push-ups also engage the front shoulder muscles (anterior deltoids) as they assist in the pushing motion.<br>
Triceps:<br> Inclined push-ups target the triceps muscles (located at the back of the upper arms) similarly to regular push-ups, as they are engaged to extend the arms during the movement.<br>

                <h1>DECLINED PUSH-UPS
                </h1>
                <p>Decline push-ups are a dynamic bodyweight exercise targeting the upper body muscles, notably the chest, shoulders, and triceps, while engaging the core for stability. By elevating the feet on a platform, such as a bench, these push-ups intensify the workload on the upper body, promoting strength and muscle development. </p>
