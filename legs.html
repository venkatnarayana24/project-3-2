                <p>Muscles Targeted:<br>
                    Chest (Pectoralis Major):<br> The primary muscle group engaged during the dumbbell bench press.<br>
                    Shoulders (Anterior Deltoids):<br> These muscles assist in stabilizing the movement.<br>
                    Triceps:<br> They play a secondary role in extending the arms during the press.<br></p>

                <h1>Leg push
                </h1>
                <p>It refers to a physical exercise commonly performed in strength training routines. It primarily targets the muscles of the lower body, including the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes. The exercise involves pushing a weight away from the body using the legs, typically with equipment such as a leg press machine or resistance bands. Leg pushes are effective for building lower body strength, improving muscle tone, and enhancing overall lower body functionalÂ fitness.</p>

            <div class="work3">
                <h1>SQUATS
                </h1>
                <p> These are compound exercises that engage multiple muscle groups, primarily targeting the lower body, including the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calves, while also involving the core and upper body for stabilization. This exercise involves bending the knees and hips to lower the body into a seated position and then rising back up to the starting position. Squats can be performed with body weight, barbells, dumbbells, kettlebells, or other resistance equipment. They are highly effective for building lower body strength, enhancing muscle mass, improving functional fitness, and promoting overall athleticism. Proper form and technique are essential to maximize benefits and prevent injury during squats </p>
