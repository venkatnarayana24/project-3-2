                <p>Lateral Deltoids (Middle Delts):<br> These are the muscles on the outer side of your shoulders. When you perform lateral raises, youâ€™re specifically working these lateral deltoids. They play a key role in shoulder joint abduction, allowing you to lift your arms up and out to the side123.<br>
                    Anterior Deltoids (Front Delts):<br> Located at the front of your shoulders, these muscles assist with movements during pushing exercises (like bench presses). While lateral raises primarily target the lateral deltoids, they also engage the anterior deltoids to some extent3.<br>
                    Posterior Deltoids (Rear Delts):<br> Situated at the back of your shoulders, these muscles contribute to maintaining proper posture and shoulder joint rotation. Although lateral raises focus mainly on the lateral deltoids, they also involve the posterior deltoids<br></p>

                <h1>Front raises
                </h1>
                <p>Anterior Deltoid (Front Delt):<br> The anterior deltoid is a small triangular muscle located at the front of your shoulder. Its primary role is to flex the shoulder and move your arm forward. When you perform front raises, you specifically engage this muscle group. Without a well-developed anterior deltoid, everyday tasks like reaching for items on a shelf or putting on a T-shirt would be challenging 123.<br>
                    Secondary Muscles Worked:<br>
                    Lateral Deltoid:<br> The side portion of your shoulder also contributes during front raises.<br>
                    Posterior Deltoid: Although not the primary focus, the posterior deltoid (back of the shoulder) is involved to some extent.<br>
                    Upper Chest:<br> The clavicular part of the pectoralis major (upper chest) gets activated.<br>
                    Upper Trapezius:<br> This muscle in your upper back play a role as well.<br></p>
